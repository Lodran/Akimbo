Akimbo is a re-imagining of the Mendel frame, designed to address specific goals.

  1) Improve the frame's clearance, particularly for the X carriage and extruders, with particular focus on dual-extruder clearance.
  
  2) Make the frame easier to assemble correctly.
  
  3) Make the frame more rigid.
  
  Points 1 and 3 are addressed by tilting the top of the frame outward, at an angle, and by increasing the separation of the top horizontal rods.
  
   Point 2 is addressed by reducing the part count, and by providing parts that enforce frame geometry wherever possible.  In particular, the Z axis geometry is much easier to assemble correctly in that simple jigs can be used to create correct geometry, rather than having to use a plumb-bob.
